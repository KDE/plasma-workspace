About kxmlrpcclient
----------------
This library contains simple XML-RPC Client support. It is used mainly
by the egroupware module of kdepim, but is a complete client and is
quite easy to use. Only one interface is exposed to the world, 
kxmlrpcclient/client.h and of that interface, you only need to 
use 3 methods: setUrl, setUserAgent and call. 

A small note on authentication. If you will be accessing an XML-RPC server
which uses HTTP-AUTH, simply set the user and pass in the KURL. To use 
Digest authentication, call setDigestAuthEnabled( true ).
