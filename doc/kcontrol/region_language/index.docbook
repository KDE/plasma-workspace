<para>
On this page you can set your preferred languages and formats for the &plasma; Workspace and
Applications to be displayed in.
</para>

<para>
In most cases, you can simply select the language, and all
options will be set in an appropriate manner.
The &plasma; Workspace and &kde; Applications are written in American English and are
translated into many different languages by teams of volunteers. These
translations need to be installed first before you can choose to use them.
</para>
<note><para>Ensure that you have installed the &plasma; language packages or translations for the
languages you want to use.</para>
<para>As &plasma; is build upon the &Qt; libraries, you need the &Qt; translations for the selected
languages as well to have a fully localized &GUI;.</para></note>


<para>
On each selection bar you can see examples how the settings look
like and which measurement units are used. In addition to numbers, you can see
how currency values, dates, and times in long and short format are displayed.
When you change any of the settings, the preview shows the effects of the
changes before you apply them.
</para>

<para>
Clicking on the <guilabel>Add more...</guilabel> button on the language
sub page will show you the list of available
languages and will initially show your currently selected language. If the
selection shows <quote>No Language Configured</quote> then you have not set a country
and are defaulting to the language set by the system, normally C.
If the language you want to use is
not shown in this list then you will need to install it using the usual method
for your system.
</para>

<para>You can remove a language from the main list by selecting it and then clicking
on the <inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="list-remove.png" format="PNG"/>
</imageobject></inlinemediaobject> icon. You can change the order of preference in the
list by selecting a language and clicking on the <inlinemediaobject><imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="go-top.png" format="PNG"/>
</imageobject></inlinemediaobject> icon.
</para>

<para>
In case you need different individual format settings,
you can select the locale for <guilabel>Numbers</guilabel>, <guilabel>Time</guilabel>,
<guilabel>Currency</guilabel> and <guilabel>Measurement Units</guilabel>.
</para>

<note>
<para>
Previously, Language and Formats are independent settings. Since &plasma; 5.26, they were
merged into this KCM called Region And Language. Changing a language does
<emphasis>automatically change</emphasis> the settings for numbers,
currency &etc; to the corresponding country or region. However, this change
does not break the old configuration. The configuration file still located
at <emphasis>~/.config/plasmalocalerc</emphasis> .
