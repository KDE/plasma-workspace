 * @short A unified tasks model.
 *
 * This model presents tasks sourced from supplied launcher URLs, startup
 * notification data and window data retrieved from the windowing server
 * the host process is connected to. The underlying windowing system is
 * abstracted away.
 *
 * The source data is abstracted into a unified lifecycle for tasks
 * suitable for presentation in a user interface.
 *
 * Matching startup and window tasks replace launcher tasks. Startup
 * tasks are omitted when matching window tasks exist. Tasks that desire
 * not to be shown in a user interface are omitted.
 *
 * Tasks may be filtered, sorted or grouped by setting properties on the
 * model.
 *
 * Tasks may be interacted with by calling methods on the model.
