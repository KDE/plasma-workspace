/**
 * This class filters child mouse events that move from a current location towards a given edge.

 * The primary use-case being where we have a list of actions that trigger on hover on one side
 * adjacent to a large hit area where a user will want to interact with.
 *
 * Without this filter a user moving their mouse towards the target area will trigger other hover events
 *
 * This item distinguishes mouse moves towards an edge from attempts to select another item in the combo
 * tree.
