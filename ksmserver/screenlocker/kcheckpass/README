The KCheckPass authentication software:
-----------------------------------------

KCheckPass is KDE's authentication program. It is meant to be
used by any software in need of user authentication, most
notably screensavers.

It enhances security be the following means:

- It's only a small program, which is hopefully simple enough to
  allow it to be SUID root. Setting it to SUID root is necessary
  on Shadow Password systems.
- No other program in need of user authentication, must be
  SUID root.
- It provides a single implementation to check passwords. So one
  only must take a closer look at KCheckPass to ensure password
  security. It's much easier for programs using KCheckPass to
  preserve security.


Technique:
----------
KCheckPass is a simple password checker. Just invoke and
send it the password on stdin.

If the password was accepted, the program exits with 0;
if it was rejected, it exits with 1. Any other exit
code signals an error.



Compilation hints:
------------------
Compile with -DHAVE_VSYSLOG if you have vsyslog().
Compile with -DHAVE_PAM if you have a PAM system, and link with -lpam -ldl
  (If libdl is present).
Compile with -DHAVE_SHADOW if you have a shadow password system.
