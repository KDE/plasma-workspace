# FindEpoll
# --------------
#
# Try to find epoll or epoll-shim on this system. This finds:
#  - some shim on Unix like systems (FreeBSD), or
#  - the kernel's epoll on Linux systems.
#
# This will define the following variables:
#
# ``epoll_FOUND``
#    True if epoll is available
# ``epoll_LIBRARIES``
#    This has to be passed to target_link_libraries()
# ``epoll_INCLUDE_DIRS``
#    This has to be passed to target_include_directories()
#
# On Linux, the libraries and include directories are empty,
# even though epoll_FOUND may be set to TRUE. This is because
# no special includes or libraries are needed. On other systems
# these may be needed to use epoll.
