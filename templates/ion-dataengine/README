Plasma Weather Ion Dataengine
-----------------------------

-- Note --

Remember that this dataengine relies on a semi-public API,
as exposed by the "plasma/weather/ion.h" header.
While this API has been the same for some time, there is no guarantee
that it will be stable for all future versions of the weather dataengine
as part of Plasma Workspace.

The main purpose of having this interface semi-public is to allow everyone
to easily develop adapters to more weather data providers,
without needing to work directly in the module plasma-workspace.

Once your ion dataengine is nicely working, please consider to merge
it into the KDE module plasma-workspace with the existing ion dataengines.
Looking forward to cover another weather data providers with your help :)


-- Build instructions --

cd /where/your/ion/is/generated
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=MYPREFIX ..
make
make install

(MYPREFIX is where you install your Plasma setup, replace it accordingly)


-- Test instructions --

Test your ion dataengine with
plasmaengineexplorer --engine weather
where you should see your ion listed in the default data "ions".
You then can test the ion itself by entering into the field for "Source name" e.g.
%{APPNAMELC}|weather|foo
or
%{APPNAMELC}|validate|foo
with "foo" being some location term which makes sense for your ion dataengine,
and triggering the button "Request Source".


Or try to use it from the Plasma Addons Weather widget.
Start the widget in a test window with
plasmawindowed org.kde.plasma.weather
and then see to use your ion dataengine by configuring the widget to use
a weatherstation provided via your ion dataengine
